### Analysis

- In this analysis, we evaluate Capomulin against several other anti-cancer medications. The various medications in this analysis were evalutaed by subjecting 249 mice with tumors to 45 day testing regiments. The mice genders were nearly evenly split between male and female mice.

- At the conclusion of this analysis, the box plot showed that Capomulin had a lower final volume of tumors compared to infubolin and Ceftamin and similar to Ramicane.

- The line plot also demostrates that the drug works quickly with tumor volume decreasing quickly until it hit it lowest at day ~35 for Mouse l509.

- Lastly, we also found that tumor volume is highly correlated with weight which needs to be factored into treatment.
